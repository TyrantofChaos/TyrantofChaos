   I really love Games and Stories. To me a game is more than the mechanics and code, it's the character, the writing, the world, and feeling lost in a reality parallel your own. A good game is fun to play, a great story will be remembered, but a great game is fun to play and tells a story and the player will remember for the rest of their days. The first time I played Tales of Symphonia I got lost and couldn't figure out how to progress, the second time I got lost in a cave looking for a ladder, but the third time I finally beat it, saved the day, and smashed two planets together. I remember this because of my experiences with the story and every time I gave up it left this empty feeling because I wanted to know what happened to my favorite characters. I want to give others that experience, I want to create a game that makes players remember their favorite character as if they were real.
